	This is the first update for the jekyll blog for step 6 in lab 3. In this project I created a repository and linked it to my github website. 
	I then downloaded Ruby and used it to install Jekyll. The only part of this i found notable was relearning navigating via the command line
	as i kept mistyping. In fact I am concerned it went a little to smoothly and that as a result I lack the understanding usually hard won through
	fixing what has been broken. I then modified files using notepad++ as my prefered general editor. I am a bit confused about the requirements for 
	step six and feel that I am probably not understanding them enough to sufficiently satisfy them.
